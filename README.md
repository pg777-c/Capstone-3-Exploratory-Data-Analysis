Exploratory Data Analysis, Capstone #3 Data Science Bootcamp, Task 34

AN EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT.

THE TASK BRIEF IS SET-OUT BELOW.

Compulsory Task 1

The instructions for this capstone project are found in the Capstone Project II.ipynb file. You will be doing EDA on a movies dataset. To do this, you will need to:

- Load the dataframe in

- Clean the data

- Remove duplicate rows

- Discard entries with a zero movie budget

- Manipulate certain columns to the correct data type

- Answer the questions about the data

Follow these instructions clearly and use the EDA_doc file as a template for creating a report to explain your visualisations, investigations and findings.

Re-create what you did in Compulsory Task 1, but for the automobile dataset.

Create another report called automobile_eda.odt using EDA_doc as a template.

Follow the same steps as you did in the previous task.
